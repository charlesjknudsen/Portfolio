Part I: The Apocalypse

Abomination of Desolation

The modern push for Artificial Intelligence, automated jobs, and universal basic income
has enveloped large political figures. Proposals for AI and the rush to establish it could be, in my
opinion, compared to the intensity of the greatest tech races in history. And, admittedly, the
promised utopia of abundance seems to be quite a difficult thing to find fault in, after all, who
wouldn’t want paradise? But I would entreat you, then, my very astute reader: How do you know
the difference between the world and paradise is lack of things? These proposals are man’s
latest—and last—and vain—attempt to snatch heaven for himself. And I have reason to believe
these things have been outlined in detail within prophecy.
Let us consider this peculiar name which appears in the end time prophecies of Daniel
and Revelations within the bible, “The abomination of desolation.” I am increasingly convinced
this name is not descriptive of desolation, but in fact descriptive of abundance. That is, this name
is saying some item which makes a mockery of desolation—it is an abomination of it. This name
coincides with verses speaking of the “daily sacrifice” being taken away. Sacrifice, as it may be
understood in the realest sense, is what is done when someone goes to work or does acts of love
and service. One sacrifices their self and present time to the future and others in the most abstract
sense. In a more practical and specific sense, for the sake of example, one sacrifices their money
for a homeless man in an act of charity. Or, in a biblical example, a man would sacrifice his goat
to God—or the community—which, in the same ritual, is eaten. He therefore sacrifices an animal
for the greater promise of prosperity in his household (food and sustenance). This is a sacrifice to
God because it is enveloped in the creation story at the core: is it necessary to take an animals
life to feed oneself and their family? Yes, because God created man above animals, and God also
created man in His image. This means life is valuable and must be sustained, and it is
permissible to come at the cost of animals. Therefore, sacrifice is given to God, and the sacrifice
is necessary, even if the cows are really cute.
The destruction of the daily sacrifice we know, however, is not referring merely to
Levitical priestly laws concerning animal sacrifice (though this may not have been understood by
Daniel, since he lived before Jesus). But, since it is pertaining to the end times, and Jesus has
already offered Himself as sacrifice for our sins, we then know this daily sacrifice is referring to
more abstract and deeper meanings—more practical and related to our understanding of
sacrifice. The original sacrifice in old testament law represents for us the symbolic concept of
sacrifice in our lives. It is symbolically and deeply contained in the biblical animal sacrifice. For,
as Paul wrote, the laws done away with by Christ in the old testament were “shadows” and
“copies” of the real—of heaven. The animal sacrifices were then symbolic of the deeper internal
sacrifices made by men morally, such as the self-sacrifice done in service and love. Therefore,
the daily sacrifice, which is taken away by the abomination of desolation in the end times, is
rather the elimination of sacrifice in its entirety. This is the destruction of work and a need to
lack or give in things, and this is accomplished by having unlimited abundance on earth. For
Abel offered his good sacrifice and pleased God, by doing his hardest work and giving up his
best fruits. But Cain was lazy and did not give up his best to God, and therefore suffered lack of
reward. Cain, therefore, in his last accomplishment, desires to not concede to God and sacrifice
properly, but eliminate the need for sacrifice in its entirety, and seize, what, in his ability, is
understood to be his rightful reward. And thus, through abundance, he lifts up the abomination of
desolation, and he destroys the daily sacrifice. Why would he need to sacrifice anything if he
may live with no lack?
And you may say, “But how could you be against abundance? Would this not be
paradise?” So do you not remember that, though man already resided in paradise, he still went
willingly to sin? That it was not God who put man out of paradise, but in fact Adam who, in
paradise, for want of more, introduced death and sin? “Better is a little with the fear of the
LORD, than great treasure with trouble. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a fatted
calf with hatred.” And so, therefore, it is neither by possessions or luxury which paradise is
gained, but by love. And it was not by lack of things man was thrown out of paradise, but by his
own evil lusts and schemes he was banished. For possessions and luxury do not satisfy, as
Solomon wrote, “hell is never full, so are the eyes never satisfied.” And he himself, having all
riches and luxuries, took on which was against God’s law, and worshipped idols while taking
many wives. And even in his many possessions, wisdom being included, still these were not
enough for him.
And so, how is it you know man will be happy with possessions? Will he not crave for
more? Crave for meaning? What rich man has prevented himself from getting richer? You
yourself likely have more than enough possessions and yet do work to acquire more. And yet to
be satisfied with the Godly things, these are the fullness of paradise on earth. But because we no
longer are in paradise, man’s allotment is only to do the work of Christ. For we are told the earth
is passing away, and we are told that it is only vanity to grasp for heaven on earth—for heaven is
not a kingdom gained in this age. For man’s heart desires love and eternity, not possessions and
selfish gratification, as the wicked deceive themselves with. But these aspects are not attainable
on this earth, and therefore a man only may gain salvation into a future kingdom by Christ.
And what are the prospects of heaven? Is it not the reign of love? For we are told to love
our God with all our hearts, and to love our neighbors as the first commandments. But how could
love be possible without sacrifice? “Love suffers long and is kind…does not seek its own.” But
to do these things, one must sacrifice their own desires and time. In fact, according to Jesus,
“There is no greater love than this: that a man would lay his life down for his friends.” Jesus
implies the greatest love is the sacrifice of one’s life for others. This great love, under the
elimination of sacrifice, would then be done away with. And what, then, is one living for in a
world devoid of love and full of possessions? Or should I say to you, “But what does it profit a
man to gain the world, but lose his soul?” I say surely, there is no profit to gain all luxuries,
pleasures, desires, possessions, and any other manner of self satisfaction, for our allotment is to
love. And with no love, our romance and dreams come to nothing, but we are instead left with
sadness, loneliness, and a bottomless pit of hedonism. So, in conclusion, it is not without
sacrifice that love exists, and neither is it worthwhile to live with infinite abundance. But, in fact,
the abomination of desolation is man’s poor heaven, in which he disagreed with God's
parameters of suffering and sacrifice as compositional components to paradise, and proposed
rather his own self-satisfaction instead—existence with no sacrifice. And so, in the final thought:
is the abomination of desolation a good thing? No. Will many be taken to believe it is their
salvation? Unfortunately, yes.
The Temple in Which It Is Erected
Throughout the prophecies of Daniel, a discussion of wars and kings is elaborated on.
Extensively, the prophecies can be paralleled to the wars of Greece and the Medes and Persians.
The symbolic dreams of beasts are also correlated to these kingdoms, of which the final may be
understood as Rome. There is a given time distance of seventy weeks, of which the first sixty
nine “since the going out of the word to rebuild the temple” can be traced to the death of Christ.
From this, scholars believe the final week to be the seven year period of tribulation in
Revelation. Daniel is told part of his vision is concerning the “latter days.” The angel even says
to him, “Go your way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.”
In this prophecy, however, are many references to the historic kingdoms, and even
explanation of the abomination of desolation. How is this so, if these prophecies are to concern
the end times? We may look at the separation between description of history and future prophecy
by noting a distinct shift in the text: “And some of those of understanding shall fall, to refine
them, purify them, and make them white, until the time of the end; because it is still for the
appointed time.” From this verse, our ability to recount historical events ceases, and we can be
more certain we are now reading verses concerning the apocalypse, as the succeeding transition
is the word “then,” meaning it is the events at the time of the end; also, the ambiguous “until”
implies an indefinite time period. Note also, the explanation of the “appointed” time.
Moreover, in the final verses, Daniel is unaware of all the events in the end, and is told to
go his way. Meaning this “appointed time” is concerning prophecy not yet revealed in its
entirety, concerning a further future; this prophecy, in part, is further revealed by John in
Revelation through his writing of the vision of Jesus Christ. Again, here, there is a mention of the
abomination of desolation: “And from that time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the
abomination of desolation is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.”
Therefore, we have two distinct periods in which the abomination of desolation appears; it
appears once in prophecy (now history to us) concerning the Greek empire, and again in
prophecy occurring in the apocalypse. We must, then, identify both cases of the abomination of
desolation.
In the first case, scholars hold a general consensus that Antiochus IV Epiphanes is the
“little horn” coming from the fourth beast in Daniel’s vision which speaks blasphemies. In the
prophecy, he is the one responsible for placing the abomination of desolation in the temple—he
is identified as the “Northern King” in the bible. Although the prophecies do not explicitly state
Antiochus or go in detail about the events, we have an account of his persecution of Jews and
wars. During such wars, he entered the temple and stopped daily sacrifice. He scratched out
“YHWH” and inscribed Zeus upon the altar. He slaughtered pigs and smeared their blood,
defiling the sacred place. And of this history, Maccabees also recounts the wars and rebellion
which incurred to stop this. This occurrence, I believe, is the first abomination of desolation. But
it is not the true abomination of desolation, but the shadow of it; for if also the temple is a
shadow of the heavenly, how would Antiochus have done something besides a copy of what
would occur when the second abomination of desolation is raised up? Therefore, this is the first
occurrence of the abomination of desolation, which had its brevity in their time period before
Jesus Christ, and I think it is representative of the future true apocalypse, which will have a new,
more hefty weight against the even more powerful reality of Jesus Christ and His sacrifice.
How then will this second abomination occur? It is concerning the temple in which it is
erected. For when Jesus came, the definition of sacrifice changed; but also, the definition of
temple was changed. Jesus refers to His own body as a temple, and the New Testament writers
also reference our bodies as tabernacles and tents. In Hebrews, Paul outlines the detailed aspects
of the temple described in Exodus and Kings, and reassures these things are representative of the
heavenly temple. We may then be certain our bodies are more true temples, which house the
image of God and the Spirit given to us by God.
We are also given a mention of it by Jesus Christ when He explains, “‘Therefore, when
you see the “abomination of desolation” spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place’ (whoever reads let him understand), ‘then let those who are in Judea flee to the
mountains.’” It is noteworthy Jesus describes it as the “holy place.” And it is also interesting that
a rare aside occurs, which entreats the reader to understand; of this, I believe it is implied that
only those who read in the future and study further would be able to best know what this phrase
means. I believe this is so, because the abomination of desolation is such a strange thing, and
because the temple and holy place it is erected is not only perhaps a physical temple, but the
heavenly and spiritual place within the body.
Moreover, this provides further proof for us of a second abomination of desolation in
Daniel’s prophecy, since Jesus lived after the time of the empire’s wars described in Daniel. Of
all these things, we may conclude the abomination of desolation will, in the future, be erected in
a temple; perhaps it is physical, bodily, or both (and I think it is most likely both). But I believe
there are many other aspects of the abomination, end times, and the sayings of Christ which we
may attribute to the abomination being in the body. These sayings, along with our previous
explanation of the nature of this abomination, begin lining up when we consider it in the body,
along with our modern developing technologies.
Relation to Babylon
Before we consider the full picture of this phenomenon, we must first examine its
symbolic and meaningful relationship in the kingdom of Babylon. Babylon is an archetypal
kingdom of human engineering, pride, idolatry, and sin. Babylon is the kingdom at the end of the
world, when wickedness is full grown. It is derived from man’s constant desire to overthrow God
and establish his own empire, and it begins its debut with the first attempt in Genesis. The first
Babylon kingdom is of the Tower of Babel, and this primal attempt gives us insight to the most
fundamental phenomenon occurring in this archetypal evil kingdom.
In the first case, it is just after the flood. Men begin building a tower tall enough that it
may reach into the heavens (what they perceive the sky to be). This is done to make a name for
themselves, and so they may not be “scattered.” This fails in the end when God separates them.
But there are a few noteworthy aspects of this story which are extremely important.
First of all, let’s examine the psychology and intentions of the people. The tower being
built towards heaven is an outward expression of men desiring to reach paradise and happiness.
We know this since heaven, in a more true sense, (revealed by Christ when He preached) is
actually the place of paradise and love. It is that eternal romantic dream in the hearts of men,
where there is no pain. But also called heaven in the bible is the “firmament.” Which, in Genesis,
can be understood as the atmosphere of the earth, or the skies. These two descriptions of heaven
may be joined in some metaphysical way not yet completely understood, but for now, we may
understand they are obviously associated with man’s proclivity to equate the divine, romantic,
perfect, and beautiful with upward, infinite, and the awesome and sovereign nature of the night
and day sky. As to why God relates the sky to His kingdom, I suspect it is related to heaven
being loose from the constraints of the earth, and it therefore represents absolute freedom. But as
to why man relates the sky to the kingdom of heaven placed by God in his heart, we may simply
observe it is due to the awesome and religious effect it makes on him in some deeper way.
Perhaps this effect is rooted in his observance of the freedom and rest provided.
Speaking of heaven in the true sense, which is it being some abstract place of freedom,
peace, love, beauty, and perfection, we should observe this is the constant motivating effect of
every human. Every person is attempting to reach some “better” place. Every person finds
themselves dissatisfied. For this heaven, I have already explained why it is satisfied by the
promise of Christ; for men will find that, when attempting to gain this “better” it always alludes
them. Though, yes, man can love and make things more beautiful, it nonetheless remains true
that the wicked will do wickedly, and he himself will be imperfect, incapable of establishing
everything as it should be. And therefore, it is necessary that the sacrifice of Christ is
implemented, so that man may maintain his freedom, and a new nature may be given to him and
creation, so that it may establish the kingdom of heaven. And by God’s plan it is ordained we
must labor in birthing pains of this tribulation so that we may be in heaven with free will and not
subjugation.
In order to achieve this kingdom of heaven, the Babylonians worked in a way neither of
God in the Old Testament or of Christ. But instead, they build a tower to make a name for
themselves, working with the primitive notion that reaching the sky may result in paradise.
Moreover, they do it in order to make a name for themselves. Making a name for oneself is
something God does in Exodus. Man replacing God’s importance by his is then an act of pride
and usurpation, in which man desires to have power, control, and omniscience—man desires to
be God. This is the best and most deep definition of pride, and these men desire to create such a
name for themselves. Moreover, God mentions that they have one language, and have therefore,
“become one.” So, they are making an empire with a single name, and this empire has, in a way,
become a singular being which is composed of multiple beings. They then exalt themselves not
just in an individual pride, but a pride of an empire; an empire which they deem more important
than God.
As to why they built a tower toward heaven, this is their motivation. Their desire is to
engineer by their own ability their part in paradise. According to them, this is by replacing God’s
law and authority with their own. But there is an issue with this proposal, and it gives us insight
into why they built a tower and rest their proposal on their ability to engineer their way into
heaven. That issue is the flood. Last time, when men disobeyed God, they were wiped away with
a flood. This story is archetypal of a simple concept called “the consequences of your actions.”
It is well known to us that when we make mistakes we suffer the consequences. The
definition of sin, in fact, is based on the idea that evil actions cause suffering and death (this
definition is given in the Garden of Eden story when sin destroys paradise and introduces death).
So, if men desire their own rules and not God’s, it means they desire sin. And when one sins, it
means they suffer punishment as per the rules of nature. A simple example of this would be a
lazy farmer. Such a farmer commits sin of sloth, and when he reaps his reward, it is starvation.
This differentiates into all sorts of relational and living troubles with suffering and ends with
death. Thus, the farmer is limited in his sin. Even if the farmer wants to be lazy, he knows he
can’t, since he will be punished. This sort of thing happens on a broader society level, and it is
represented archetypally by the flood story, in which society is destroyed by a flood. This
phenomenon is repeated throughout the bible. Whenever the nation of Israel sins, they are
destroyed. When they don’t sin, they remain alive.
Therefore, the Babylonians are forced to address this issue. They propose, “I would like
to establish my own empire and rules, and I believe this is how paradise is gained. However, if I
do not follow God’s rules, then I will be in trouble! Therefore, I must construct something which
prevents me from suffering the consequences and allows me to participate in all my sin.” Thus,
the Tower of Babel is created. In the ancient days, we knew these towers to be Ziggurats. And
ziggurats are actually very effective surviving through floods due to their height and high
structural stability. Being a nation near water sources, as most ancient flourishing agricultural
nations were in Mesopotamia, meant also being vulnerable to floods when it rains. Ziggurats,
and associatively the tower of Babel, were then purposefully flood resistant. This makes sense to
have been done with intention, since this event takes place right after the world flood, which is
caused by God’s punishment for man’s sins; the only ones saved were righteous Noah and his
family.
We may therefore summarize the psychology of the tower of babel as so: men desire
heaven. They also desire an empire of their own rules which disagree with God. Their intention
is heaven, which is associated with the sky. This association is the elevation of man from all
earthly restrictions, and a gaining of freedom and paradise. This is promised to us by Christ, but
for the Babylonians, they disagree and desire it not by God’s rules, but by their own empire's
rules. And therefore, they design systems and engineer things that prevent them from punishment
when engaging in all their sin; by this, they believe they may gain absolute freedom and
paradise. This is achieved by men’s collaboration and becoming “one.” It is their desire to usurp
God, because they disagree with His plan and heaven.
To clarify this psychology, I will give a brief example of it occurring in a practical sense.
The invention of digital pornography is a more developed Babylonian attempt for such reasons:
men desire sexual gratification and women at their leisure. They do not want to follow God’s
rules of love and marriage. Therefore, they attempt rape or polyamory. Unfortunately, this has
emotional and physical consequences that harm them, the women, and the community. They
therefore desire a way to exert power, so that they may be in control of everything and not suffer
consequences (usurpation of God; making a name for oneself). They then desire to become kings
and rule over others, alleviating their consequences with riches and power. The kings suffer more
and more issues with their greed, and as society progresses, men progress in technology. They
design photographs, movies, and digital devices. So they replicate the sexual gratification of
multiple women on digital devices and create strip clubs. This is all to satisfy their flesh rather
than their spirit and the spirit of others with love. This is also fundamentally associated with the
rejection of sacrifice, since they refuse the sacrifice of their time, effort, emotions, and
opportunity with other women so they can satisfy their lusts in flesh. Therefore, because they
reject sacrifice and the consequences of immoral actions, men have engineered digital media and
markets to satisfy their own desires, so they can gain sexual pleasure without sacrifice or
suffering the consequences. They refuse the effort to court and impress a girl, and they refuse the
consequences for sexual immorality. This is the construction of an empire by man’s own name,
rather than Gods, who is a God of love and the created world (non-engineered).
This example, however, is only in part achieved; as was the method of kings and riches
only in part achieved. For the men are left with loneliness and poverty by these things. So,
therefore, the wickedness has not reached its fullness, for the men have not achieved their design
exempt from negative consequences. This is the key aspect of relation to the abomination of
desolation. The Babylonian story gives us insight to the psychology and result of men’s
wickedness, and the abomination of desolation is the completion of it. It is the establishment of
abundance, which thus exempts man of sacrifice and consequences. The abomination of
desolation must share qualities, then, of the tower of babel for it to be effective. Men do not
possess enough power individually, nor the intellect. But by the combination of language and
ability in a shared prideful interest, they may form an empire which is designed to serve the flesh
rather than love. They may collectively band together to “make a name” for themselves and
design an empire which sustains them in all their evil. Thus, the abomination of desolation must
exist in these parameters.
Finally, another fascinating point in this story is that God Himself says men’s proposals
will not be withheld from them. This is to mean that, although men are failing to reach their own
engineered heaven rather than God’s, they will one day achieve it in a true sense. We’ve outlined
men's desires and methods pretty well, so we may understand now what it really means that men
may achieve this. It means, then, that the abomination of desolation will truly be raised up. And
at this point, the kingdom of Babylon will actually come to fruition, and men will achieve their
flesh hedonism without their consequences. They will construct for themselves a reality which
disagrees with God. A world where they define suffering and happiness, and they decide what is
important. Men, then, with an empire, will form into a false heaven—a man made heaven. There
will be nothing to destroy it except God, nor will the saints be able to stand up to the delusion
any longer. And this will be brought by an empire of immense power and engineered idolatry.
Watch, therefore. They will have pleasure with no love, and they will recognize disagreement as
sin. But let no man be a judge except God. I’d rather the suffering of Christ than the pleasures of
men.

The Kingdom of Heaven

There are certain prophetic images and notions we also have to concretize our
understanding of Babylon and its abominations. The fundamental aspect is these things being
empires. There exists, without a doubt, a desire for heaven in the hearts of men. Sin is making a
mistake to reach that place, and adding sin to sin is blaming God for it rather than yourself, and
therefore constructing some false manner to solidify your say over God.
This desire for heaven and salvation in human hearts, along with their unfortunately weak
minded nature, causes political delusion. There is a certain method in which Christ’s coming
completely destroys the understanding of people who wanted a savior. The people expected some
great militant leader that would overthrow the people and establish the government on perfect
Godly law. Instead, they got a man in rags preaching. But he preached something peculiar. While
everyone looked for heaven by the establishment of a perfect empire, Christ told them strange
sayings, “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed…” Christ said their direction for heaven
was wrong, “do not look here or there for the kingdom of heaven, for the kingdom of heaven is
within you.”
Christ is telling people their salvation and responsibility can’t be outsourced to some
political regime or system. He is telling them that their problems aren’t created by others and the
government, but by their own fault. That, perhaps, in fact, if one at once acted correctly, the
whole of paradise would be realized. That the difference between paradise and now isn’t the
political unit or laws of physics, but the evil in men and their weakness. Indeed, the opportunity
was all there for humanity to at once act in love, and one’s own internal and local life would even
become beautiful if they just acted according to Christ. “Whoever loses his life for my sake will
gain it.”
Christ meant this not only as pertaining to the afterlife, but also as pertaining to this life.
Remember that this world began as Eden, and it is by man’s doing which it is taken from there.
In fact, Eden is only a distance from our actions. Heaven requires sacrifice and responsibility on
a personal level, which is why Christ preaches it as such. It first of all requires those things
because love is of the nature of heaven, and love requires suffering and sacrifice. Why love has
such a nature, I do not know. And why has God created it in such a way? I will not contend with
Him. But nonetheless, this is the nature of love, and it is exhibited by the good shepherd, who did
not just subject us to this nature, but lived through that nature, so that He may not be uncaring for
the sheep, but be caring and good. Let us not, therefore, mistrust God. But merely observing love
requires such things, and love is the nature of paradise; such parameters are deemed worthy by
God, whom I am to trust. For it is not by intellect one is saved, but by faith. And for reason of
faith, I have the proved love of Christ as reason. For He who loves us would not lie, and He who
loves truly does no wrong; and such was proved. And therefore love requires suffering and
sacrifice—perhaps temporarily, perhaps not—but this is required of us. And it is this way so that
one would not believe by intellect, but by love. And therefore, the nature of self-sacrifice to
acquire love is a worthy heavenly reward.
But besides love, of which is most important, the basic pleasures of life given by God
require avoiding sin. And to maintain a society where people are free and sustaining each other,
it requires individual integrity and work. For no system has, nor ever will, overcome the fact that
the only sustaining factor of an empire—no matter how large—is the individual integrity of the
person. Even Christ Himself, who held the most true doctrine, did not use any compulsion or
force, for He knew that was not the nature of heaven. And for this reason, it is not by the election
of a candidate or establishment of policy that the world is cured, nor by the elimination of some
candidate or policy. But it is by the conviction of every individual to avoid sin. For the good and
prosperity of society depends on this: that every man would repent and at once return to Eden.
Paradise by acquiring love is dependent on this—the “within” heaven—and paradise outwardly
for basic necessity and non-oppression requires righteousness. The cruel master nor the
oppressed slave is happy, for the master lacks love and the slave lacks comfort and freedom. So,
therefore, “love thy neighbor as yourself.” At once, the inward and outward paradise in those
men would come to be.
For even if it were possible for society to sustain outward prosperity, there would still
remain the inward lacking. And Christ has not come to condemn us, but to save us. And
therefore, the rules and regulations of Christ are not oppression as man’s government, but
freedom from the bondage of flesh and sin. For man’s doing is drunkenness, adultery, and the
bondage of money. But Christ’s doing is the moments of rest and peace given to us, and the
purpose found in overcoming hardships—the romantic adventure. And all manners of suffering,
both internally and externally inflicted, are not cured by the infantile dream that some
government salvation will occur, but it is by Christ’s teachings. “Repent! For the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.” For paradise is only a distance of our individual actions, not an election.
In summary, let’s examine the difference between man’s heaven and Christ. Christ
preaches men gain peace by following him, and this extends unto the local and community level.
This is what Christ means saying, “The kingdom of heaven is as a mustard seed.” For it begins
merely as a word, then it extends into action and inner resolve, then it extends into the
surrounding individuals and prosperity, and, in the perfect picture, into the entirety of society.
And it is by this means in which the suffering of the world is cured, both of the widow and the
rich man. But man, who desires evil, refuses to love and do good, yet nonetheless desires the
kingdom of heaven. So, therefore, in his selfishness, he becomes a hypocrite; he outsources his
immaturity with a blame for the system and others, and then blames poverty and suffering of
others on the world. He then concludes he ought to exert control over everything to make it at
once how he believes it should be, rejecting Christ’s acceptance of suffering.
He then imagines things would at once be cured if one would just write in a certain law or
establish a system that forces men to be his version of “good.” He imagines there is some grand
calculation in which he may deduce men perfectly and at once establish utopia, making a mistake
that his knowledge is proficient in this, though he is only dust. He imagines his salvation in some
political leader and hedonism. And the politicians imagine the same, so they preach to the
people, “We are not to have poverty! We are not to have oppression! I will save you!” And by
this word the man is convinced, and he throws up for himself selfish tyrants and dictatorial
systems, in which he hopes everything is refined and controlled by that great intellect he prides
himself in. He takes away his own freedom because he can’t cope with responsibility or humility.
And thus, the eternal psychology of the Israelites is revealed, when they would repeatedly protest
against Moses, saying he is the cause for their suffering, then proceed to beg their way back to
slavery in Egypt. And therefore, because of their sin they suffer, and they correct it not with
repentance, but double down and curse the world; so they believe they can fix everything with
some system or empire. They condemn anyone who hates their idea, and become the most
abhorrent hypocrites. The entirety of one’s moral composition is dependent on what they vote
for, and yet the same people who hand out such condemnation live lives of filth, hatred, and
suffering. To be more blunt, they protest with signs proclaiming bravery and morality for
themselves, post on instagram shaming lines for others who aren’t protesting, then go on in their
lives to do vile debauchery, walking right over the bodies of the poor.
And besides the wickedness, there is also a misunderstanding of reality. With the worship
of pleasure and hedonism, money is elevated to a sort of status of savior. Money is the
manifestation of quantity which deduces the system. Money is access to power, sex, and other
abominations. When someone becomes so deluded to believe everything comes down to “the
system” and not their actions—when they believe their frail intellect has everything discovered,
and yet they are lost—they then become convinced money is the bottom of reality. They do not
consider that money is merely a measurement of goods and labor, which come from the
individual work of the community, but understand it as some infinite source of prosperity. And to
give them credit, as society becomes increasingly large and systematized, it is difficult to
understand modern life outside of money.
But because of this delusion, men become convinced that, if a politician promises some
money or free service there is absolutely no lie, consequence, or failure in such. And therefore,
because of their hedonism, power, and system worship, they coalesce all these things into money,
and they worship it as a savior. This is the root of slavery, which comes under different names
depending on the time period—socialism, fascism, or communism. The people believe that
politicians are capable of fixing human nature and the world by simply providing money, and
they see this as more important than sacrifice because they desire not love for the poor as they
claim, but selfish desire for power and gratification. And so the emergent philosophy of money
systems that will at once save the world begin being erected, and these systems we have seen
throughout history in the horror of sin's completion: Stalin, Mao, Hitler, and others in their
massive bloodshed and oppressions. Notably, Hitler was, for example, praised by the German
people.
But such people who actually benefit from this worship of money are not the workers,
poor, or widowed; but the haughty and greedy. Since in a government system these promises of
free service and goods must come from somewhere, the people are extorted by taxation. This is
why Jesus markedly scrutinizes the “tax collectors.” These people are the benefiters of
oppression upon others. And yet, such people market themselves hypocritically, as if they were
saving the poor. Such an example is shown when Jesus confronts the Pharisees, who can be
imagined as modern politicians against the working class.
When the Pharisees seek to trap Jesus, they ask Him if it is good to pay taxes to Caesar
the king. This can be understood indirectly as a promise for communism, which proclaims
salvation for the poor, which can come about by no other means by overly-extorting the workers
for welfare. Jesus asks them whose inscription is on the coin. When they say “Caesar,” Jesus
then says, “Render therefore what is Caesar's unto Caesar and to God what is God’s.” Christ
points out that this promise for political salvation for the poor by taxation is a lie by the
Pharisees, and that they are tricking the people into believing as much. He points out the obvious
fact that the money doesn’t go to the poor, but the king and leaders.
Such an irony can be recognized in politicians, who condemn others for not voting for
their welfare plans, and yet live with millions of dollars, not extending money to the poor. Such
is the false philosophy of people, who give little money to the poor, but vote in taxing politicians
as if that were the same. Who does the will of God? Jesus explains when He proposes the parable
of the good samaritan. It is not the politician, the party voter, nor the priest which walks by the
impoverished, but it is the man who helps him. The kingdom of heaven is not by policy, vote, or
some system, but it is by the actions of men. You claim to be righteous? Help the poor, don’t
push your political agenda.
It is for all these reasons Christ says to the Pharisees, “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.” For
in Levitical laws taxes for sacrifice were incurred. But this is not the sacrifice Jesus wants, but
He desires an internal sacrifice: mercy. The sacrifice of one’s own self by forgiveness, service,
and submission. For these are the sacrifices Jesus wants, and these are the ones of love. And
therefore taxation and policy is not our salvation, but to love your God with all your heart, and to
look on the poor with compassion.

The Beast

My explanation of heaven is good to understand the more detailed and complex aspects
of Babylon, which is political psychology and money worship. These aspects are important since
they are the manner in which things are systematized, and this is the manner in which empires
are held together in sin. Allow me to explain the nature of the prophetic beasts, what they
represent, their nature, their future, and how they integrate into Babylon, the abomination of
desolation, and man’s false political heaven. As for the preceding details, keep in remembrance
man’s tendency to worship money, and all the issues of political worship I have pointed out; you
will begin to see parallels before I even discuss them.
First, we must understand the nature of the first beasts in Daniel’s prophecy. The most
notable point is these beasts represent empires, and when they grow horns these represent kings,
kingdoms, or leaders. The crowns which are sometimes put on the horns represent kings of those
kingdoms which are a part of the larger empire. During Daniel’s visions, these beasts rise up with
appearances representing symbolically Babylon, Medes and Persians, Greece, and then Rome.
To these beasts, an Angel interprets them as empires. Later, we are shown a ram and goat with a
horn, which represent the Greeks fighting the Medes and Persians (these empires are represented
symbolically twice by two different creatures). The bodies of these beasts, respectively, are a lion
for Babylon, a bear for Medes and Persians, and a leopard for the Greeks.
For the final empire, however, there is a very special case in each of the visions. The
empire of Rome is represented by a beast of iron teeth which smashes the residue under its feet.
It is also paralleled to the empire at the end of the world, which is more fierce and terrible than
all the other beasts. Moreover, in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, it is represented by material of iron
and clay smashed together. This material composes the feet of a statue for which the other
empires stand. Before we examine what occurs in the prophecies with these empires, let us note
the aspects in connection to our understanding of the complexities of these empires and our
abomination of desolation.
The previous beasts and empires are merely representative of collections of people in
their idolatry into some empire. The fundamental rejection of sacrifice for self-serving function
is exactly why these sinful empires are represented as beasts. Pride and selfishness makes a
person into someone operating merely on their desires and instincts, and this is why they become
as if they were a beast; they act primal and unruly, loving nothing but their primitive urges. The
person therefore becomes like a beast, and we are actually shown this idea when
Nebuchadnezzer reaches his most prideful moment and loses his ability to reason. A collection
of such bestial people into a kingdom forms one large beast. Notably, these empires descend
from the Babylonian one, and therefore we can understand the empires as sharing characteristics
and philosophies of Babylon; such philosophies and nature are outlined in the Genesis story,
Daniel, and John Lennox’s examination, of which I will not explain extensively, else I would
convolute my point. But besides the more detailed explanation, we should simply remember that
we possess the psychological error of the tower of babel and worship of hedonism and money.
These empires coalesce into the Roman empire, which is more fierce than all the others.
The Roman empire is different because of its rigorous systemization and power over the
populous. This is highlighted by the fact it was formed by such mixed cultures and nations—of
bestial and prideful people each seeking their own way—and yet held together; it was held
together as a sort of brittle alloy of iron and clay. This represents the systemization of legislature
and money coalescing massive populations together despite their difference. Such a system is not
unknown to us in the US, but it is especially terrible in Rome, in which they did not have the
strength of Christ until He came, who highlights the individual guidance to being one in God,
rather than the differentiated philosophy of government and culture saying to find your own way
in pride rather than “The Way.”. And, according to the prophecy, what caused its collapse is the
movement inspired by Christ. That is, the church and God. And according to prophecy, this
metal beast was destroyed.
From this we may note that the properties of the final apocalyptic empire is noteworthy
for its systemization, and it is the container for the previous beasts, which possess the sins,
idolatry, and philosophy of Babylonians. This concoction of aspects is what makes it so fierce,
evil, and powerful. This systemization is done by technology, which is sustained mainly by
energy with metal conductors. Moreover, metal is the forge for construction of automobiles,
buildings, planes, rockets, and weapons. Thus, the difference of the beast being metal shows us
among the systemization is the technology to enforce it. Therefore, the final apocalyptic empire
is different in its intense systemization and advanced technology, but it is not different in its
immorality. For, as in the vision, the metal empire acts as the feet for the other empires; it is the
ground in which the bestial pride is able to stand. So the final empire is the glue that holds the
evil together, whereas the evil was already always there. And since you know morality is not by
knowledge, but by love and faith, you understand technology develops, whereas morals do not;
and so, humanity becomes more like foolish children with powerful toys rather than transcendent
beings.
We may be certain that the Roman empire’s government and legislature was destroyed,
but of the nature which composed that empire it was not. For although Christ concussed the
beasts, we are told that, though the dominion of the first three was taken away, their lives are
prolonged. And so, though the Roman empire was done away with, as the prophecy explains the
metal beast was destroyed, its components from Babylon remain living without dominion in the
world. The full grown philosophy of evil therefore permeates in our cultures, and it yearns for
totalitarian dominion over the church. The Roman empire's adhesive for the iron and clay was
destroyed, meaning its government and legislature demolished, and the metal beast cast away;
but the culture remains, and the final beast will come again in the nature of the Roman empire’s
proclivity for technology, systemization, and power.
And indeed, we see such a design occurring as we progress in modern day. Although
civilizations throughout history would exert oppression, we have never reached the horrors as in
the 20th century. Nuclear bombs, gas chambers, tanks, assault rifles—all methods of exerting
control and tyranny upon others, all derived from Canaanite philosophy. And, in a more abstract
sense, large digital economic systems entrapping people in debt and bondage, large academic
institutions captivating people due to career limitations, and all sorts of other strange systems
which entrap people designed by men. These things become more possible as technology
develops, since more ability to enforce unfair laws is put in place; also, more capacity to develop
abstract and complicated exploits of fraud which confuse the people and pit them against each
other in politics. People end up, when looking for a solution, due to their lack of literacy and
understanding of obscure bills and economics passed in legislature—they end up pitting political
leaders against each other like their chosen pokemon. Political discussions therefore become less
political and more “my guy beats your guy.” And the people are even trapped in perplexity.
And, if the people decide to dispose of the oppression, what can they do? What can one
do to stop oppression when the leaders have clubs? They stand up with a small majority. What if
they have swords? Some strategy and weapons of their own in a larger majority is required. And
if they have assault weapons, military, missiles, and other things? The populus is nearly helpless
to their own established slavery. Whatever system they entrap themselves in because they hoped
it would save them is now their suffering and bondage. The abomination of desolation, therefore,
is not just infinite abundance, but it is the establishment of an impenetrable and horrific prison by
economic systems and technology.

Revelation

We know the beasts represent empires, and we know the final apocalypse is brought
about by some empire. There are, however, many strange things which occur in Revelation, a lot
of which are deeply symbolic. I won’t be dogmatic about when things occur, nor if something is
purely symbolic or literal. I have strong evidence that beasts do not literally begin rising and
roaming the earth, but I wouldn’t be infinitely opposed to it being possible. Nonetheless, for the
sake of clarity, I am going to only discuss the specific important details of beasts and prophecy
which explain the abomination of desolation only. And, in the second part, I will begin
discussing all the symbolism and ideas that relate to further analysis; the other unexplained
portions of Revelation. This further analysis will be done assuming my deduction of the
abomination of desolation is accurate, and it will be done in the second part.
In Revelation, we are also given some description of empires as apocalyptic beasts.
There, first of all, exists a dragon which ascends from the bottomless pit. This is the devil and
serpent from the garden. I am not going to attempt to describe this here, but we should merely be
satisfied this represents evil and satan. Then, another beast arises from the sea. This beast is an
amalgamation of the first three beasts in Daniel, and is visually described as possessing each
part. It also is described with heads representing kings, and it also has a wound which had
healed. This wound can be presumed to be the damage done by Christ in His first coming. We
therefore may recognize this beast as the beasts in Daniel combined into one culture and empire,
having prolonged its life until it regains dominion in the apocalypse. We then may conclude this
is the rise of the sinful empire in its fullness. Perhaps it comes out of the sea since it is of chaos,
the unknown, and darkness; things which are akin to lack of understanding and therefore
wickedness and hatred. Perhaps, also, there is literally something in our physical sea which we
have not discovered due to our limited ability to explore. Nonetheless, the sea possesses some
formidable and sinister nature in its depths, whether symbolically, literally, or some transcendent
mixture of both. It is also noteworthy that in the New Jerusalem the author makes an effort to
mention that there is no sea. I am satisfied to conclude the sea represents chaos and the unknown,
things which sin has partnership in.
When the second beast emerges, it comes from the earth. It has the appearance of a lamb
and speaks like a dragon. This form I believe represents some king or group of kings; that is,
political leaders or otherwise. Perhaps it is a broader field of influential faces. Ones which are
hypocritical, putting forth an outward righteous and innocent appearance, and yet leading the
people on with dictatorial and evil speech. Essentially, our archetype dictator. This is likely the
king in Daniel who comes forth at the end of the world which “knows sinister schemes.” The fact
that he comes from the ground could highlight that he is a man, since he is from the dust, which
Adam has come from and will return to.
The man also persuades the people to worship the beast. This is the classic manipulation
of politicians to have people worship the government. And this is embedded with the deeper
fascination in people to worship their own desires and false empire of paradise. Therefore,
through this hope and foolish desire for salvation, politicians and leaders often capitalize on this
to persuade the people into believing they will be saved if they worship their foolish and selfish
desire (the beast). They therefore justify it with an outward appearance of righteousness,
covering up both their and the population's guilt by covering it in an appearance of innocence,
although the words being spoken are evil. This is the consistent pattern of hypocrites and
dictators, and this sort of deceit is how they continually gain power. This usually ends in some
version of communist utopia, which of course, is more of a horrid dystopia where the people are
exploited. It is justified by pleas of welfare to proclaim compassion and love, and it is really an
end goal to sin like sexual immorality and sloth, both for the leaders and the people. Thus, this
persuader causes the persecution of the law-givers and righteous, which are the saints. And the
leader reaps the ripe sin of the people to indulge in abominations and exploit. The appearance of
the lamb, but the tongue of the dragon.
This second beast causes the worship of the first beast. This is the natural course of a
self-seeking political figure, since the best way to persuade a populus in any direction you want
is to compel them by fear into your regime which will save them from all their issues. Therefore,
what ensues is worship of the state and system by the people, whether they are consciously
aware of it or not. This reflects Nebuchadnezzar's city, in which he dreamed of his own city as a
gold statue, and therefore erected a gold statue for everyone to worship. And thus, he enforced
worship of the state. And this is the means a dictator is established: when all the people become
too immature to self-sacrifice, and therefore shrink in fear of their individual responsibility. And
so, they willingly relinquish all power to the state and put themselves in slavery and subjugation
to a system. Moreover, keeping a civilization docile and foolish is a good way to secure power. It
is also a good way to realize your horrible vision, which is the empire of lusts you seek to
establish.
The beasts also continue to create an image of the first beast, which is then also forced to
be worshipped. This image is especially interesting. Let us first remind ourselves what it means
to worship an empire. Referring again to our first story of Babel, in which the people sought
heaven by their own sins and freedom, we may understand the vision of these people. They seek
to establish a unruly nation which satisfies their bestial lusts, a nation which requires no
sacrifice, and is therefore devoid of love. This they desire for the same reason a toddler wants
cookies. And so, they engineer every means to arrive there. They mistake the imprinted desire
for love and eternity with their short term materialist gratification. They wonder at the mystery of
knowledge and evil. This is the worship of the first beast and the state.
But the worship of the image of the beast allows for an even more insane outcome. There
is a certain worship of this kind done with our technology. Our phones, movies, and media
project images of realities to us. They are images of what people worship. In fact, the algorithms
for Tik Tok, Instagram, and other content are dependent purely on what your attention is directed
towards. A professional psychologist will understand well, that the many complex systems and
beliefs which establish where your attention is drawn are complex and rooted upon your values
and heart. Moreover, your attention is often quickly seized to worship primitive desires.
When you scroll through your feeds, you are given what maximizes your watch time.
Therefore, the things you watch are a good representation of the things you worship. And, very
often for such a crude form of attention, such things will be akin to the grossest envies, lusts, and
other evils (not to say everything is bad). And, with the advent of AI video, the projection of
things has reached a point of infinity.
Artificial intelligence videos provide for the viewer infinite and impossible
manifestations of reality. These are projections, so to speak, of relationships, stories, worlds, and
empires. It is a projection of what the viewer worships, since it is designed to maximize
attention; this is by design both by the merchant of the app and the viewer. The participant, who
is carelessly indulging every fantasy, desire, and fascination accruing on their feed, then begins
worship of an image of their heaven, which is based on nothing besides the most primitive and
thoughtless of desires. This is the worship of an image of the beast, for it is the projection of that
false heaven based on lusts of the flesh into images, and then it is worshipped by the people, and
it is by implementation of the preceding state and empire. And so, though the first beast was
worshiped in parameters and limitations, the projection of it into an image allows infinite
possibility without consequence. And thus, the abominations of artificial intelligence multiply.
The people may worship any sensuality they can and can’t imagine, and they have to commit
themselves to no labor once it is accomplished in entirety. But of such, though we see many
things, we are just in the beginning.
Neuralink
Let me get to the point now. The abomination of desolation, I hold, to be a combination
of all the previous things I have described. And it is likely the mark of the beast. We are told
whoever receives the mark will not go to heaven, and it is a number of a man: 666. I believe this
mark is a piece of technology which accomplishes the goals of the Canaanites and Babylonians.
It is possibly blasphemy of the Holy Spirit. It is the event horizon in which the world itself finds
no return. And I will explain why it accomplishes all these things, and why it is the abomination
of desolation.
Neuralink is a recent technology for brain implants. It currently merely works as a
prosthetic enhancer. But users are even able to control digital games, and some extended
technologies have created essentially telepathic communication (although the ears are still used,
so not yet). When Neuralink is translated to Greek, which is the original language Revelation
was written, it translates to Νευραλίνκ. Greek letters have number associations because their
alphabet doubled as numbers. For this it would be Ν=50, ε=5, υ=400, ρ=100, α=1, λ=30, ί=10,
ν=50, κ=20. The sum of these numbers is 666. There also existed a certain rule in the Roman
empire, which is paralleled to the apocalyptic empire in the bible, whose name was Neron
Caesar. This name, when translated to Hebrew and following the same steps, also adds to 666.
Nero was an intensely oppressive ruler and slaughtered Christians. Caesar the name meant ruler
or empire. Neron, relating to modern day and Nerualink, might be recognized to represent the
neurons in the brain. Although, its original meaning would simply mean, “strong.”
Characteristic of this mark is the ability to buy and sell. And, it isn’t just a number, but it
is explicitly stated to be the number of a name. “And that no one may buy or sell except one who
has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” We are also instructed to
“calculate” the number, which means it is not reaching or unreasonable to do addition with
letters according to an alphabetical name.
Of this, the primary innovator, who I have hesitated to mention but now find no way to
avoid, is Elon Musk. I don’t make any claim for accusation against Musk, I believe these
technologies would appear with or without him. But the bible tells us those who do not confess
Christ are of the antichrist. I don’t intend complaint or accusation, but only a recognition that
those who do not follow Christ are subject to the torrents and evil of the world, and as leaders,
may only possess more power to participate and advance it. For Musk may be doing it in an
attempt to secure safety for people, as he understands this world has no escape from the
dependence on technology and destruction of itself. This world is indeed passing away, but Musk
is deceived to believe to save it in any other means besides the calling of Christ. God save Him if
his heart is genuine. We are called out of this world, and that is the only means in which it may
be saved; if we reflect heaven rather than the world. Nonetheless, the prophecy of the apocalypse
is written.
As for Musk, he himself, who is the arbiter of these technologies, has made statements
that Artificial Intelligence will soon replace our devices. According to his predictions, which
weigh heavily due to his participation in it, the people will have access to auto-generated videos
for whatever they desire. His goals include universal income by automatic labor from robotics.
The first portion of his vision may be understood as the beast which rises. It is the vision
of an empire which sustains the sin and bestial desires of the people. It is looking upon the
people and saying, “Rather than freedom and convincing people to do good, since this is
impossible, we will simply develop technology that will avoid famine and collapse of civilization
regardless of their sin.” It is rising the tower of babel above the flood waters, attempting to reach
into heaven. And so, this is the establishment of the first beast, in which a vision of a worshipped
amalgamated culture and empire is solidified by the grand economic system: “universal income.”
The people will no longer participate in the sacrifice of labor or things, but gain access to all
luxuries without effort. The people’s hearts, which are already growing cold in consumerist
society in the US, will begin hardening to an extent of loneliness and sensualism as never before.
They will sin and be kept from destruction, since robotics and things already automate their
safety and production. It would be the actual realization of the socialist utopia. This is the
technology and system nature of Rome which holds together the fragmentary amalgamation of
prideful, rebellious, and hateful cultures. Its establishment is money, which is the quantified
power and hedonism allotted to the people, in which they may go as merchants purchasing their
lusts. This is the establishment of abundance and the abomination of desolation. But our
description is not complete.
The final establishment is the image of the beast. This image is an extension, for even in
this society the people will still find themselves suffering internally. They will possess so much
hatred, loneliness, darkness, nihilism, emptiness, and hopelessness due to their selling
themselves to vain lusts. And they will find themselves unsatiated still. And therefore, they will
extend the nature of our AI media abominations to an extent never before. If one is confronted
with this idea, “I have altered the outer world to a perfect degree. I have satiated everything, and
yet I still feel awful, then what is the issue? Ahh! It is that wretched heart of mine. I give it all it
desires, and I still feel terrible! I must then alter myself inwardly, so that I am happy.” This is the
same sort of thing which occurs for heroin addicts and those who trust in pharmaceutical drugs.
The belief that one’s issue is how the world is created—a blaming of God. But not only to the
extent of the physical, but also the internal. They find issue even with how their own heart was
made. Their own brain and DNA.
Remember when I was describing love, and how it requires suffering and sacrifice? It is
of this nature by design of God, and I do not know why. But so are our internal emotions
designed by a sort of law. When someone we love dies, for example, we are subject to grief
whether we like it or not. When someone wrongs us, we feel anger and sadness. It isn’t up to us
how our emotions go, but only what our actions are. And so, if one follows the selfish desires of
hedonism, they will find dissatisfaction and sadness in their hearts, whether they like it or not.
They have overcome the laws of nature to sustain themselves in their sin, but have not attained
their false heaven because a sadness nonetheless remains. Therefore, their last issue to conquer:
to extract the very essence and law within their emotions that desires to love. The removal of the
internal daily sacrifice.
The Holiest Place
Man now has taken away any necessity to sacrifice and given to himself every luxury, but
he still yearns for meaning, and his heart desires to love. But because he is stubborn to refuse
sacrifice, he concludes instead to remove his desire to do good and sacrifice. He therefore
removes his desire and capacity to love, for he has decided it is too intense of an ask. He does not
correct his desire for love and meaning by casting away his lusts and idols, but instead by casting
away his desire for love and meaning. Is this not true of man? If man's nature was not so, why do
the rich chase after more riches? Why do kings look for more territory? It is the bondage of his
endless desires for sensualism at the destruction of sacrifice and love.
To understand the meaning of this process and its relation to Neuralink and prophecy, we
should understand how the biblical symbolism and prophecies show, through the mark of the
beast, the relation of Neuralink and the abomination of desolation. So, to understand this, we
may describe the temple and its contents, and how we might parallel these things which represent
the body.
In the holiest place of the tabernacle of God in the bible, there exists three things
contained. Within golden pots inside the ark of the covenant is the Manna which fell from
heaven to feed the Israelites in the wilderness, the rod of Aaron which budded to prove God’s
staff and law brought forth fruit while the others didn’t, and the tablets of the covenant. These
things are behind the second veil. The second veil is torn when Christ is crucified in the gospels.
In Hebrews, we learn the meaning of this tear. Again, our description of the temple being
a body is brought back. We are told the physical temple is only representative of the real, and
that, therefore, the second veil was symbolic in that the holiest of holies was still inaccessible.
This means the inner consciousness and spirit is neither interacted with or understood in its
divine relation. This is what is both revealed and accessed by Christ's example, sacrifice, and
teachings. The inner psychology and heaven of people which, according to the bible, pertain to
things hidden since the foundation of the earth. Things which are taught by Christ and His
person, in which many men and prophets of the old testament desired to hear, but never heard,
and therefore never saw behind the second veil. And for this veil, Christ calls Himself the serpent
raised in the wilderness; for He is the revelation of the unconscious and a person’s inner spirit.
For recognizing the flaws and fears in one’s own spirit, and understanding all the hidden
identities of themselves portrayed by Christ who is the light, looking upon Christ cleanses their
darkness and ignorance, allowing light and understanding of their inadequacies and fears. For
this spirit, the people may clean through the belief in Christ, and may work in the divine law by
their hearts. And this is the tearing of the second veil.
And therefore, the priests offered sacrifices outside of that area, but only once a year
entered the holiest place and used the blood of animals for remission of sins. However, when
Christ came, His sacrifice entered into the holiest place, and in that place He entered not to the
symbolic, but to the heavenly. And He therefore offered His own blood, which is much more
valuable and capable of cleansing one’s conscience. We are also told Christ entered this temple
in heaven.
First, we should remember what is meant by heaven. We are not able to describe the full
nature of heaven, since we are limited in our sight. But we can make observations about what is
told to us. Heaven is associated directly with paradise. We know heaven is a kingdom of paradise
and perfection as described by The New Testament, but also, since it is an extension of the
Abrahamic covenant, which is the original covenant God gave to his descendents, that they
would enter the “promised land” which flowed with milk and honey. And therefore, heaven is a
paradise. This is why I compare heaven to the eternal paradise and beauty in our hearts, which is
always receding from us as we chase it; for it is not of this world, but placed in our hearts as a
desire because it is the eternal heaven. This promise, in fact, is reflected to Noah when God
promises not to flood the earth. He gives Noah a rainbow, which when one chases, it recedes
from them. But it always remains there in its beauty. So is the kingdom of heaven in this way.
We may further be assured heaven acts as a paradise in this nature, since in Ecclesiastes,
Solomon explains at length the vanity of man in a world of wickedness and death. There is no
success and perfection in this world, and the desire for such is by God’s placement. And
therefore, we may acknowledge heaven as not only paradise, but a paradise seen within men’s
hearts and desires, yet unattainable in entirety in this realm. And so it is as a promise of the
rainbow, in which the beauty is seen from afar, and yet it recedes in the distance as one
approaches it. According to these things, we may acknowledge Christ’s parables of heaven as
descriptions of paradise. And so, therefore, when He says it is as a seed, He is describing the
means in which this paradise arrives. The true notion of individual righteousness creating a
moral and perfect society of freedom, therefore, is the kingdom of heaven which is established
by spreading the law of God and chastising people to follow it—or by planting seeds in their
heart, so to speak.
We may also acknowledge Christ’s description that the “kingdom of heaven is within
you.” For according to God the access to paradise is in our design, which is a good design in the
image of God. And therefore, we are able to obtain it. But also, that we are not to chase after
things in the world as if they will save us and give our soul peace, but to understand the necessity
to believe in Christ and follow His words, and by this means we will be granted inner peace and
therefore the heaven within ourselves. And, of course, the afterlife. Heaven is the skies, the
boundless freedom—Eden, where we are freely able to eat of God’s trees and life except for
sin—it is within you. One simple psychological deduction can help us understand this. For
example, high neuroticism and insecurity causes a large amount of suffering and pain within
someone. These behaviors and thought processes can be solved by participating in actions the
bible advises and changing the heart in the way Christ acts. Subjecting oneself to suffering for
righteousness, for example, makes one more comfortable to accept pain. And also, their
acceptance of humility means a negation of pride, and they therefore feel less compulsion to
uphold some persona, which is why they feel so much insecurity. And therefore, even one’s inner
emotions and paradise are by Christ’s example.
Knowing these characteristics of heaven being associated with someone's internal spirit,
we may also finish our understanding of its relation to the body as a temple. For the temple is a
structure in which God can reside, but there is no temple in which God can reside since heaven is
His throne and the earth is His footstool. And so, therefore, the only true temple is the one built
by God, which is the temple of the body. This is associated with its connection to heaven, for
how can the body house God’s spirit if it was only of the earth? This also matches the symbolic
temples, since they act as connections to the sky and earth, representing connection to heaven.
Therefore, heaven is the place of beauty and perfection, and it also exists especially in the
spirit of a person, inside their heart and body. In the Old Testament, before the Messiah, the law
of Moses was given to govern the people to survive and be as close to heaven as possible. But
heaven in this time was merely the promised land and perfect political society composed of
righteous individuals. Therefore, certain laws of force and violence were required so that, by
violence, the immoral criminals, warlords, and barbarians would not seize the Israelites. It is
required that some war and strict law be in place for paradise to be on earth, for the wicked need
strict and intense chastising or eradication to keep peace and prosperity. And therefore, the nature
of this old law was to correct the city on earth to as close to perfection as possible. This is
represented as the Holy land being actual physical areas. Their battle, to an extent, was of flesh
and blood. But nonetheless, because the world is imperfect, and men still carry with them the
suffering of their sins and death, there was still no paradise for the people. And even in times of
prosperity, there was still no rest; for they still felt the emptiness of sin. So, although the outer
world was, to an extent, cleansed, the inner world was not. And for the same reason a rich man
does not find satisfaction, so do Israelites who even had love were not satisfied. For even if one
continued in luxury and love as an Israelite, their impure conscience would stain their paradise.
This is because the heaven which resides truly in one’s spirit is not perfected, which is not
revealed to be perfected until the tearing of the second veil by Christ.
It is therefore necessary there is a means to cleanse even in internal emotions and
conscience weighed by sin and death to have full paradise. And it is also, consequently,
necessary that this comes about by a second birth into pure spirit into heaven. This is the tearing
of the second veil by Christ. For, at first, the priests offered sacrifice outwardly to sustain the
external and physical prosperity of the world. But after Christ, the laws changed to not require
punishment, war, or any force of the outer paradise; but instead, Christ promised the true heaven,
and therefore required not the cleansing of the physical world, but instead also the inner world.
And therefore, Christ enters not as a priest who sacrifices animal blood on the outer, but as a
priest who enters into heaven itself, behind the second veil, into the body, heart, and man's spirit,
and offers His sacrifice as purification. And therefore, the inner emotions and conscience is able
to be cleansed into paradise.
So, therefore, the priests and temple are symbolic of sacrifice as it relates to heaven. The
outer courts and physical animal sacrifice in the old testament is symbolic of an attempt to
establish earthy and outer paradise, and this aligns with the difference in Moses’ old laws, which
require bloodshed and punishment; for this is required to establish paradise on earth, but only
when done according to God’s law in that era. This is shown symbolically by the required blood
of animals, for animals must die in order for the people to eat and sustain their lives. They
therefore sacrifice the life of animals to God and the society. In some deeper metaphysical sense,
this is related to a temporary remission of sins, since they are now able to sustain themselves
from death temporarily by this. Perhaps this is related to remission of sins because if everyone
was righteous death would not occur, or perhaps the bread which fell from heaven would still be
sustaining them, because they complained and wanted meat instead of that bread.
But, although the sacrifice of animals was required to sustain them physically, they still
were subject to sin and death. They were also still subject to the imperfection and
non-satisfaction in their internal spirit, for the true home of man is not attained. And therefore, it
was necessary that Christ was sacrificed not for the external world, but for the eternal heavenly
life in spirit. For Christ entered into the holiest place and sacrificed Himself and sustenance for
the Spirit rather than the physical body. And therefore, Christ calls Himself the “manna which
fell from heaven.” He tells His disciples on passover to eat of His body and drink of His blood.
He acts as the animal sacrifice, but is not sustenance for the outer physical body, but the inner
holiest place and heavenly body. And so, just as animals physically shed blood to sustain our
physical bodies, Christ spiritually shed blood to sustain our spiritual bodies, suffering many
things in his consciousness and forgiving us.
This, therefore, could perhaps be the mercy seat which is placed above the ark of the
covenant. Since mercy is the internal sacrifice of one’s own feelings by forgiveness, which is a
spiritual sacrifice. And therefore, Christ told the Pharisees He desires, “mercy not sacrifice.” For
Christ desires the sacrifice of our internal spirit so that we may be cleansed by His sacrifice. And
therefore, the sacrifice was changed to be in the holiest place, which is to be done in the inner
spirit rather than in the outer physical world. And, therefore, the ark of the covenant is covered
by the mercy seat and cherubim. For it is by these things in which we obtain mercy and are able
to enter heaven. Again, this may be noted that Christ, in one of the very rare asides in the bible,
says to the Pharisees, “Go and learn what this means.” Meaning there are complexities to these
words we must further analyze, and therefore it may not be arbitrary to assign these complex
meanings.
Now, therefore, this is why the manna which fell from heaven is within the holiest place.
It represents whatever divine occurrence is sustaining the life of our spirit in spite of our
darkness and evil. It is the lamb slain from the foundation of the world which allows us to live.
And not only to live physically, but so that our spirit can have light in it. This is as far as I am
able to interpret, and although I feel as if I am only comprehending in part, I have no more to
say.
Besides the manna, there is still the rod and the tablets of the covenant. The tablets are
our internal convictions and guilt felt by us for our wrongdoing. It is told to us that the law of
God is written on the hearts of men, and so, therefore, this internal placement of the law is
representative of this law which is placed in our hearts. This is the basic mediator of compassion
and love which convicts those who don’t even hear of the word of God. It is why people have a
sense of right and wrong, and yet will say up and down they don't believe in right and wrong.
This is because, behind the second veil, there still is the laws of God written in them. And only
their belief in Christ would tear this veil, so that they can understand themselves and the world.
This law is actually called the tablets of covenant. It is called this way because our moral
foundations are actually based on the future and hope. The conviction of the law in a person's
heart is due to their understanding of how their actions will affect others and themselves in the
future. And they only may comprehend that such a thing is bad because they have the internal
desire for heaven, which is a place of perfection. If they had no internal vision of the perfect
within them, that is, the covenant, they would not understand nor care about the imperfect nature
of their actions. And so, therefore, for one to be convicted by the law of God, they must have an
understanding of a paradise in which they are straying from. They think to themselves, “I could
be at peace, and yet I have caused violence.” And they therefore, due to their understanding of
different futures, understand that their actions are responsible for the suffering; they then feel
sadness and conviction, and by this the laws of God are in men’s hearts. So then, the eternal
heaven which is put in men’s hearts also operates as the law of God written in them as tablets.
The final object inside is the rod of Aaron. The rebellion of Korah in the bible is a story
in which they blamed the patriarchs and law for all their unhappiness, and they believed that
paradise existed before the law. Korah and his rebellion therefore decided that establishing their
own laws would be the cure and establishment of paradise. You may already find parallels to
Babylon and Cain in this philosophy. But, as proof that the law of God was better than all the
others, the leaders all put their rods together. The only rod that budded was Aaron, showing only
the law of God was the one which brought forth flowers, whereas the others came to nothing,
proving Korah’s and others' ideas false. It is, in fact, by the laws of God which good things
come. I encourage my reader to read the story themselves to have a deeper understanding, for
there are many things I am glossing over for the sake of my point.
Aaron’s rod is then put in remembrance, so that the Israelites may remember that the only
law which actually brought forth good was the law of God. This operates as symbolic for lessons
learned by example both on a societal level and basic human level. Such a thing can be
understood simply in its meaning: one may argue for which is good, “Is it good to drink alcohol
or not?” And they might remember, for example, “When I drank, all these problems occurred.
And when I didn’t drink, those problems didn’t occur.” By this simple remembrance, the person
may understand the law that brought forth good was. “Don’t drink alcohol.” This is the
symbolism of Aaron’s rod budding over the others, which may have said, “Do drink alcohol,”
and brought forth no flowers.
Memory is essential for building one’s own character. Memory, in fact, is the portion that
allows one to develop and be created by God as life progresses. Aaron’s rod represents memory
according to the law, and what bears actual fruit. It represents one’s capacity to renew by
learning new things and changing their mind. For it is good for one to change in accordance to
the law of God by learning things which cause no fruit and things that do cause fruit. And
therefore, the budding of Aaron's rod represents one's capacity for memory, learning, and change
for the beautiful.
Thus, these form the components of the ark of the covenant in the holiest place: The
capacity to learn (Aaron’s rod), the internal law and framework of understanding the world (the
tablets of covenant), and the sustenance for one’s spirit (manna from heaven, which is Christ).
These are all contained in the ark of the covenant, for they are necessary for one to obtain the
promise of Christ. First, the ability to learn so one may confess and repent. Second, the law of
God and covenant so someone may comprehend the desire to do so. Last, Christ’s sustenance, so
that one may be redeemed from their past failures and imperfections. And all of these things are
sustained also by sacrifice.
Lucifer, The Adversary
Love is the essential law of God. And love requires sacrifice. Therefore, all the
components of one’s inner temple which is good and capable of love requires sacrifice.
Therefore, if the inner sanctum was desecrated, love itself would be desecrated. And if sacrifice
was taken away as a requirement, then love itself would be taken away. Neuralink and Artificial
Intelligence fit the bill quite well for all these things, unfortunately.
To understand why these things will arrange together in the way I am about to predict, we
must note our understanding of the great sin of Lucifer. From the psychology of pride and satan
we may correlate the original and continual ultimate sin by the snake’s deception which occurs in
humanity. And by this sin, we may see how all the components I’ve outlined work together to be
erected in the bodily temple and accomplish the Canaanite and Babylonian vision. Moreover, we
may be able to, with this reasoning, justify how it forms into Neuralink and Artificial
Intelligence.
First of all, let's note what pride is. Pride is, on a basic level, a desire to be revered above
others and have power over others. This is correlated to the knowledge of good and evil, for the
original sin by the snake’s deception was pride. This is pride because inherently, a desire to be in
control and placed above others is a desire to be God. God, for example, is allowed to honor
Himself because all His works are good. Man is not allowed to honor himself, since not all his
works are good. And therefore, God is allowed the place of worship and authority, and man
continually strives to be in place of God. This, in the most fundamental sense, is what pride is;
the desire to usurp God.
We can further deduce how this is related to the knowledge of good and evil. To know
good and evil means to know every consequence, past experiences, intentions of heart, and
futures of all things and people. Moreover, it requires a knowledge of the fabric of the universe,
in a sense, to know whether the structures of existence are good (the philosophical debate of
nihilism, which Cain settles upon). God has—for what purpose or ability we have no
knowledge—decided to limit humans in their capacity to know the future or all things. He does
this, yet also gives them the free will to act and create by His own power and spirit, as man is
created in the image of God. This is how evil is introduced, since man in his limited knowledge
makes decisions that disagree with God’s design, and he is capable of such since He is given free
and creative spirit by God, which influences creation and reality.
God has designed it this way so we may operate based on faith. And because it must be
by faith, we then require an intent of heart, no matter the circumstances, to do good to others.
And therefore it is not by knowledge, but through the design, it is by faith in God one acts
righteously. And if one disagrees with this statement, either because they believe morals can be
deduced or God is wrong for this, then he is only participating in the same sin we are describing.
For committing this sin of pride, we may identify the primary motivations. In the garden,
Adam and Eve did not yet have sin and death, and we are told Eve’s motivations and the reasons
given by the serpent. First of all, the serpent offers the ability to be like God through implication.
This directly relates the sin to pride as we discussed. Eve also noticed it was pleasant food, and
desirable to make one wise. Therefore, our motivators are pride, wisdom, and appetite. But
primarily, we should start our discussion with appetite.
For it is by appetite and desire pride is the consequential conclusion. Since Eve desired
the apple, she faced a question: “Is it beneficial for me to eat this apple?” Now, according to
God, who created the universe and has authority over reality, He says it is not, because she will
die. The deception is, “I am more knowledgeable and powerful than reality itself (God), and
therefore, I am able to participate in this desired fruit without consequence, and it is good that I
do so.” This sort of reasoning is actually at the root of all sin, and this is how all sin is related to
pride; the original sin is not just in Eden, but it is the first sin every person makes.
For when someone steals, for example, their sin begins with a desire for the object. Then,
knowing the consequences of harm to others and their gained criminal situation, they face a
challenge to God. “I know this is wrong and will be bad for me and others, but I want this.”
Thus, the persuasion of that serpent begins, “Well, actually, this isn’t hurting others, and this is
what is right. Those capitalist pigs that eat off the backs of the poor deserve it anyways, so really
I’m doing everyone a favor. Besides, I’m not getting caught, I’ll just leave with it in my pocket.”
Therefore, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, one must justify their actions above
God’s authority to participate in their desire. Therefore, sin begins with desire for forbidden
pleasures, and it is realized by pride and usurpation of God.
In the story, Adam and Eve suffer the curses of God; for Adam, it is to work; for Eve, it is
to have much sorrow and pain in conception. These operate as preventative measures for them to
taste the forbidden fruit and become like God, as they are cast out of the garden. This is also
related to why wisdom is among the fruit, since wisdom allows access to manipulation, control,
power, and discovering more pleasures. And so, the natural component of pride is also a worship
of intellect. First, because intellect is your ability to justify your actions, which, when disobeying
God, acts as a replacement for love and faith. And therefore, as we are seeing in secular society,
people end up mistaking intellect and knowledge for morality. Moreover, intellect is worshipped
because it allows the people to control others and the world to their bidding, therefore forcing it
into what they want.
One strange thing about humans I can’t necessarily explain is that they have an inherent
desire to be worshipped. And so, intellect is, for this reason, also praised. It is access to power
and worthiness. I expect this desire may be encoded in humanity's sense of justice. One who has
intellect and exhibits control, in their pride, believes as if all they are doing is good, though they
might feel guilty. And therefore, it might follow, that because what they do is good, they deserve
the praise and worship of other people, so that thankfulness should be shown. But, we may
simply observe worship is something reserved for God, and for some reason, when one desires to
have the place of God, they also desire the things given to Him, like worship.
So, therefore, man will disobey God for worship, intellect, and pleasure. And these are
the root sins for all other sins, in which we may then categorize sins as worship for man’s pride,
intellect, and pleasures above God’s call for love and faith. However, it is not the use of intellect
or pleasure which God hates, but the disobedience of God by these things. For God provided that
all trees could be eaten, except the tree of pride and forbidden pleasure. And desiring freedom
from God’s rules, man was cast out of the garden, no longer free to eat of every tree, including
the tree of life.
This brings us to another very interesting aspect, which is the tree of life. God created the
universe and deliberately gave the curses of work and sorrow to Adam and Eve. I would argue
God did this for these things to act as inhibitors for their desire for the evil pleasures and
usurpation of God. Since God said, “lest they eat of the tree of life,” and therefore cast them out.
For if they ate of the tree of life, now possessing understanding of moral law and the forbidden
pleasures, they then would be, with enough longevity, able to be like God, and transcend the
bounds of the world to form their own worlds, which they desire. God, then, saw fit that their
actions were immoral not by the bounds of reality, but immoral by the bounds of metaphysical
reality; that is, by the bounds of the law of spirit rather than the physical.
For the law of God is given by Moses for the physical. The laws which keep one from
catastrophe in a world where work and sacrifice is required. But, in the garden, there was no
curse of work and sacrifice given. And therefore, there would be no bad consequences if they
participated in moral actions. If they continually stole from each other, for example, they could
continue in this evil because they won’t run out of resources produced for them by the paradise;
and if they did, and ended up in poverty, they still would not die. And therefore, there was no
limit to how depraved one could be, since they would not be stopped by death or other
restrictions of sacrifice.
God, therefore, decided that there exists a different type of immorality which is
unacceptable: that man should form the world and create it to his pleasures and things, which
would be devoid of love. And so, for this reason Adam was kicked out, so that he may be limited
in his ability to make his own sort of world according to his knowledge and desires. God, then,
sees man unfit to form a world. And for the problem of suffering, one might understand it to
exist because man was given free will and power near to God, and so that he may enjoy it
without creating hell, he is bound by Adam’s curses.
This fundamental disagreement is what motivates the apocalypse and man’s desire to
usurp God: he disagrees with how the world is made. That is to say, God doesn’t just disagree
with lust because it harms people physically and damages the prosperity of the community, but
he abhors lust because it damages the spiritual person—the inner heaven. So, therefore, man’s
desire to lust and avoid the consequences, even if he succeeded, is still evil. Moses’ law was a
correction of the physical world, but Jesus’ law was the correction of the internal world, which
was broken even after Adam. And therefore, the paradise of Jesus is different because the spirit
of the people who entered were already perfected into love, meaning they not only followed the
physical law, but the spiritual with their hearts, which was previously unbounded (now
unbounded in this age).
But as for those who disagree, they still desire the primary categories of sin: pride,
worship, pleasure, and intellect. But also, they desire eternal life—except of course, an eternal
life of their own. They want to partake of the tree of life, of which they are unable to. And as we
know from the story of Cain and our previous deduction, his contestment to God is directly
related to pride. For he desires things his own way, and he desires not to participate in the bounds
of reality required of him, which is to sacrifice, and therefore rejects sacrifice. For Cain, he
suffers the consequences. But therefore, his descendents strive continually for wisdom, so that
they may eat of the forbidden fruit without suffering the curse given to Adam. And this is why
the worship of intellect coincides with the rejection of sacrifice, for ingenuity and manipulation
subverts the requirement of oneself to suffer the laws of God’s wrath.
This is Musk’s line of reasoning, “because the people can’t be righteous, and we are on
our way of destruction, I may make AI and robotics which will sustain the people even in their
evil.” But this is the same reasoning as the engineers for the tower of babel, who sought on their
own pride a place in complete freedom of boundless skies, making heaven on their own name
rather than God’s, and believed themselves able to do so by towering above the flood waters.
And yet, God said it is able to be accomplished if man becomes one in language. And so, the
rejection to sacrifice, pride, engineering technology, worship of intellect—all these things
coincide with man’s ultimate sins. Therefore, we may relate the abomination of desolation and
elimination of sacrifice with man’s desire to become as God, and to therefore have the
characteristics of God, which is omniscience, omnipotence, authority, worship, and control.
Desecration of The Holiest Place
Therefore, the final accomplishment of Neuralink would be to merge with artificial
intelligence. We may consider the development of technology to coincide in goal, intention, and
completion when related to the elimination of sacrifice, therefore, to usurpation of God by power
and intellect. Since AI is a database of all collected knowledge, access to this by Neuralink
means ultimate amounts of knowledge—constant querying and answers from a collection of
human libraries and conclusions. It will allow humans to know solutions and depths of sciences
and languages in instants. Even now people rely on AI to do many things for them, and in
universities they are relied upon as teachers or companions. Even in basic life choices and
questions people rely on the help of AI to guide them, putting a sort of faith in it. There is an
increased reliance on AI, and human psyche indicates the merging of one’s mind with AI will be
the completion of this reliance; moreover, it would be the natural next step to worship the image
of the beast, since it would allow direct access for the eye and mind to any desired experience
generated by AI.
The other aspect of increased ability and intelligence is the combination of the people by
telepathic communication. People gain great ability by communicating with each other, because
people are able to convey dense amounts of ordered information they’ve already done the effort
to sort through to other people, and therefore form it around a goal or idea cleanly; therefore,
one’s wisdom is accelerated by conversations more so than it would be by independent
discovery. This manner of discussion is actually how scientific literature is formed, since people
can put together large databases of different subjects to build upon each other’s knowledge.
Music, mathematics, and physics depend upon the same definitions to work together in building
and creating things. Programming itself is dependent on the computers being connected in a
language.
Therefore, the next step of expanded intellect would be the merging of minds, thereby
enacting the most express form of communication and wisdom. This is possible by the
connection of minds in the digital realm, and we already have the technologies capable of
reading brain functions into words. Therefore, the people’s collective capacity for knowledge
would extend their intelligence to comprehend the grandest of things with no work effort of their
own, and so, therefore, the merging of Neuralink to be a collective database of all human minds
communicating to each other and to Artificial intelligence will likely be the final resolution of
Canaanite desire. And because we know these things are both possible, supported by prophecy,
supported by developing philosophies and people, and likely according to human psychology, we
may conclude it is a reasonable prediction. Let me remind my reader that God said that, because
the people become “as one” they can accomplish all they propose. Therefore, this Neuralink is
the completion of Cain to attain all wisdom, sort of brought about by eating of a tree of life, since
their mind becomes composed of all the knowledge of human’s generations past and current.
Moreover, this would allow infinite worship of the image of the beast and access to
indulgences, because the people who enter into this system may have all their sensory data
influenced with projections of any abomination they desire. Not bound by the laws of reality.
They, therefore, would achieve the tower of babel, which is to extend into the boundless heavens
on their own name and laws; they would create a boundless empire by the image of the beast, in
which they indulge their false heaven of infinite sensualism, having sensory data, images, and
worlds produced by artificial intelligence at no bounds within their mind.
It is not a question of whether such technologies are possible, but rather if humanity
would subject themselves to such a thing. I imagine yes. That when humanity sustains itself
outwardly with robotic automation (the first beast) they will then be persuaded to enter into a
hive mind due to their lusts for knowledge, power, and fleshly desires. We may also be certain
such a thing will occur by prophecy, since it is the accomplishment of all the things proposed to
do in the original tower of babel. It is the attempt to reach boundlessness in the skies (the tower
to heaven). This is done so by allowing infinite sensualism with no consequences or requirement
for sacrifice. It also is the making of the people “as one.” Since entering into a massive system of
combined telepathic communication is essentially combining your mind with other minds into
one massive one. It is for this reason, also, that I speculate the mention of the mark of the beast
being the name of a man might be understood as the name of an entire empire—the amalgamated
beast. Since the people become as one being and accomplish the will of imperfect man, carrying
the name Neuralink, which is literally a name referencing connection of neurons and brains.
This is therefore the accomplishment of man taking away any necessity of sacrifice
within himself. And therefore, he takes away his capacity to love. And this doesn’t only take
place in the level of indulgence as we know, but also in the level of its deepest sense, unto the
desecration of the spirit itself within him. And, when man attains such a level of intellect, he may
even begin desecration and war on heaven and saints in a metaphysical reality we don’t currently
understand. He severs the connection of his body to God completely, and makes it bestial. This is
done when he learns his own desires of love and sacrifice in the holiest place work against his
heaven of sensualism, and he therefore decides to desecrate the holiest place within him. He
must eliminate his desire for love.
First, the establishment of a programmed system to replace is internal neuroplasticity and
DNA. This is the throwing away of Aaron’s rod, for the man prevents himself of change, and
merges himself completely with a computer which operates by levers and switches, incapable of
change, interaction with quantum potential (may physicists comprehend me), or creation of
memories. For all their memories and things are intermingled with others. Also, the false
projections of AI memories and worlds delude their comprehension of reality to any will of the
programmed set. They are no longer able to recognize which rod truly buds, they are incapable
of forming true memories, and are also, therefore, incapable of learning and repenting from sins.
They can’t differentiate reality from their autogenerated images, and therefore won’t know the
difference between any outcomes.
Secondly, the desecration of the law of the covenant. The law and guilt inflicted upon
one’s soul is seen by the man as too burdensome. Therefore, he extracts any desire he has to do
good, meaning, as explained previously, he extracts his desire for paradise, and by this means he
destroys his understanding of perfection, and therefore destroys his reference point for moral
law. By this, he destroys his capacity to understand or desire love, because moral law internally
and externally is on the basis of love. Therefore, he accomplishes his goal to eliminate any
portion of him which desires sacrifice and meaning so that he may indulge in pleasure limitlessly
and have his false heaven. This notion is, frighteningly, akin to the notions of Bhudda, which
teaches that Nirvana is obtained by completely eliminating desire within oneself. This is
incorrect, since humans also possess desires to help the poor and love others. And for this reason,
I would relate Bhudda, along with the others, to an antichrist. And I think Buddhism is likely
working by Satan’s plan to eventually accomplish such a thing, as I see people around me be
persuaded, sadly, by these doctrines.
Last of all, the removal of the manna. Since the person has destroyed their ability to
sacrifice, learn, and love, the light of spiritual sustenance ceases from them, and they become
darkness. The life that is given to them by Christ is now removed, and they are no longer
sustained by any spiritual means, but have become only carnal and of the world. Their
connection to heaven has ceased, and they are only beings of flesh and carnality. They have
become one amalgamated beast. They are the incompleteness of man, who was made on the
sixth day, and therefore does not enter into the seventh day of God’s rest. They unwittingly
subject themselves to their own hell and torment by destroying love and light in them, perhaps
doing so by giving themselves extended life, and giving themselves only sensuality and hatred.
They, therefore, will have no rest. And perhaps they craft for themselves a means to extend their
lives, being wanting of heaven, and therefore give themselves to eternal torment. They therefore
are of the number 666. Incompletion of incompletion. They are not created any longer, but
stagnant in evil, and never entered the complete story and salvation designed for them by God.
And for this reason, whoever obtains the mark will not be found in the book of life.
And by this, we may relate the abomination of desolation, Neuralink, and the mark of the
beast. And we may understand why Christ’s zeal for these things in the gospels occurs, for in the
chapters when Christ mentions the temple, He also mentions the apocalypse. He zealously tells
the merchants to get out of His temple, because they have transformed it into a den of thieves. He
then proceeds to speak of the end of days. For Christ knows that in the latter days the internal
temple will become a shopping center, in which the people only consume with their purchases,
and worship the quantified system, which is money. And they therefore desecrate the temple by
making it a den of thieves, which steal with purchase by no sacrifice their lusts.
And moreover, Christ precedes these sayings with statements of blasphemy of the Holy
Spirit. Since the Spirit resides in Christians, it may be understood that the desecration of where it
lives is blasphemy of it. And for this reason, it is unforgivable. For how can one find their way
back to Christ after entering the event horizon which is the mark of the beast? And I call it an
event horizon because that is the portion of a black hole where no one is able to escape.
In fact, this event horizon occurs when the abomination first is established. When people
begin inputting Neuralink into their innermost functions and DNA, this is the erection of the
abomination of desolation in the holiest place. Moreover, they will have access to control of
technology with their minds and limitless knowledge. They will then be able to perform signs
and wonders, and no one may be able to make war with them. And they will inflict their evil
upon the saints and prevail for the time God has ordained for them. But do not be fooled nor take
the mark of the beast. And endure with patience and courage, do not fight with sword or flame,
remembering the promise of afterlife by Christ. And moreover, understand that salvation is not
by intellect, which is a philosophy of Lucifer, but is by the faith and love in Christ.
I thank you Lord that these things were not revealed to the wise and prudent, but to the
mouths of babes.
The abomination of desolation is the establishment of infinite prosperity to sustain
humanity by robotics and automation. Neuralink is the mark of the beast and the erection of the
abomination in the holiest place, giving infinite knowledge and lusts to men, who are deceived
and deluded to believe this is their salvation. All these things will be brought about by an
incredible delusion of hypocrites killing Christians, claiming they “oppose” the good man-made
heaven, and therefore are driven to hate for them, in the same way Cain was driven to hate on
righteous Abel. So, therefore, they will construct with their intellect grand weapons and wonders.
And therefore, the kings of the earth will do great evil to enforce establishment of their vain
attempts for heaven, and as said in the book of Daniel, “will worship a god of fortresses, of
whom their fathers did not know they would worship, and they will honor it with gold and
silver.” It is of fortresses because of weapons and technology; of gold and silver for these are the
main conductors and primary metals to create databases, microchips, and AI; unknown to the
fathers because they could not foresee such strange nature of a false god. And therefore, when
such an event horizon occurs—when you see the abomination of desolation in the holiest
place—as Christ says, run for the hills. Jesus Christ be with you, Amen.
